# ==============================================================================
# SINGLETON PATTERN FOR ENSURING ONE CALCULATOR INSTANCE
# ==============================================================================

# Who: The SingletonCalculator class.
# What: Ensures only one instance of the calculator exists.
# Why: To have a single shared state (e.g., calculation history) across the application.
# Where: In scenarios where shared resources are needed.
# When: Throughout the application's lifecycle.
# How: By controlling instance creation using the __new__ method.
