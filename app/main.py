# Ultimate Guide to OOP Design Patterns: Building a Calculator with Logging and Debugging

# ==============================================================================
# IMPORTING NECESSARY MODULES
# ==============================================================================

import logging  # Standard Python module for logging events and messages.
# Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html

import pdb  # Python debugger for interactive debugging sessions.
# Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod  # For creating abstract base classes (ABCs).
# Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html

from dataclasses import dataclass  # Provides a decorator and functions for automatically adding special methods to classes.
# Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html

from typing import List  # Provides support for type hints.
# Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html

# ==============================================================================
# SETUP LOGGING CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================

# Configure the logging settings for the application.
# Logging is crucial for tracking events and diagnosing issues in applications.
logging.basicConfig(
    filename='calculator.log',  # Specifies the file to write log messages to.
    level=logging.DEBUG,  # Sets the logging level to DEBUG; captures all levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'  # Defines the format of the log messages.
    # Format placeholders:
    # %(asctime)s - Timestamp of the log entry.
    # %(levelname)s - Severity level of the log message.
    # %(message)s - The actual log message.

# OPERATION CLASSES (COMMAND AND TEMPLATE METHOD PATTERNS)
# ==============================================================================

# Who: These classes are the core components that perform arithmetic operations.
# What: Implement arithmetic operations using design patterns.
# Why: To demonstrate OOP principles and design patterns for clean, maintainable code.
# Where: In the calculator application we are building.
# When: Whenever an arithmetic operation is requested.
# How: By defining a base class and extending it for specific operations.

# We will implement the Command Pattern, where each operation (e.g., addition, subtraction)
# is encapsulated as an object. The Template Method Pattern is used to define the
# skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses.

# Why use the Template Method Pattern here?
# - It defines the algorithm's skeleton in a method (`calculate`), deferring some steps (`execute`) to subclasses.

# FACTORY PATTERN FOR CREATING OPERATIONS
# ==============================================================================

# Who: The OperationFactory class.

# Why: To encapsulate object creation, promoting loose coupling and adherence to the Open/Closed Principle.
# Where: Used whenever a new operation needs to be created based on user input.
# When: At runtime, during the calculator's execution.
# How: By mapping operation names to their corresponding classes.

# Why use the Factory Pattern?
# - It provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class.
# - Enhances flexibility and scalability; new operations can be added without modifying existing code.

# ==============================================================================
# OBSERVER PATTERN FOR TRACKING HISTORY
# ==============================================================================

# Who: The HistoryObserver and CalculatorWithObserver classes.
# What: Allows observers to be notified of changes in the calculation history.
# Why: To promote loose coupling between the calculator and observers, adhering to the Observer Pattern.
# Where: In the calculator's history management.
# When: Whenever a new calculation is performed.
# How: Observers register themselves with the calculator and are notified upon updates.

# Why use the Observer Pattern?
# - Decouples the calculator from the observers, allowing for dynamic addition/removal of observers.

# General Programming Good Practices Demonstrated:
# - **Modular Design**: The code is organized into classes and functions, making it easier to understand and maintain.
# - **Encapsulation**: Data and methods are encapsulated within classes, promoting data hiding and abstraction.
# - **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Base classes define common interfaces, and derived classes implement specific behaviors.
# - **Exception Handling**: The code anticipates and handles potential errors gracefully, providing informative feedback.
# - **Logging**: Comprehensive logging is implemented to track the application's behavior and assist in debugging.
# - **Type Hinting**: Type hints improve code readability and help with static analysis tools.
# - **Documentation and Comments**: Detailed comments and docstrings explain the purpose and functionality of code components.
# - **Adherence to PEP 8**: The code follows Python's style guidelines for improved readability.
