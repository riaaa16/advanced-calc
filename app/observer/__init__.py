# OBSERVER PATTERN FOR TRACKING HISTORY
# ==============================================================================

# Who: The HistoryObserver and CalculatorWithObserver classes.
# What: Allows observers to be notified of changes in the calculation history.
# Why: To promote loose coupling between the calculator and observers, adhering to the Observer Pattern.
# Where: In the calculator's history management.
# When: Whenever a new calculation is performed.
# How: Observers register themselves with the calculator and are notified upon updates.

class HistoryObserver:
    """
    Observer that gets notified whenever a new calculation is added to history.

# Why use the Observer Pattern?
# - Decouples the calculator from the observers, allowing for dynamic addition/removal of observers.
# - Promotes a one-to-many dependency between objects, so when one object changes state, all dependents are notified.
