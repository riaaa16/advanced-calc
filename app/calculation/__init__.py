# STRATEGY PATTERN FOR OPERATION SELECTION
# ==============================================================================

# Who: The Calculation class.
# What: Represents a calculation using a specific strategy (operation).
# Why: To encapsulate algorithms (operations) and make them interchangeable.
# Where: In the execution of calculations.
# When: When performing operations on operands.
# How: By holding a reference to a strategy object and executing it.

@dataclass  # Decorator to automatically generate special methods like __init__.
class Calculation:
    """
    Represents a single calculation using the Strategy Pattern.
    Holds the operation (strategy) and operands.

    operand1: float  # The first operand.
    operand2: float  # The second operand.

        Official string representation of the Calculation object.

        User-friendly string representation of the calculation and result.

# Why use the Strategy Pattern?
# - Allows the algorithm (operation) to vary independently from the clients that use it.
# - Promotes flexibility and reuse of algorithms.
