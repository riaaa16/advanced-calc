# MAIN CALCULATOR PROGRAM (REPL INTERFACE WITH DEBUGGING)

# Who: The calculator() function.
# What: Provides an interactive command-line interface for users to perform calculations.
# Why: To allow users to interact with the calculator in real-time.
# Where: In the main execution of the program.
# When: When the script is run directly.
# How: By implementing a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL).

# Why use a REPL?
# - Provides an interactive way for users to execute commands and see immediate results.
# - Enhances user experience and allows for real-time feedback.

# ==============================================================================
# RUNNING THE CALCULATOR PROGRAM
# ==============================================================================

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # This block ensures that the calculator runs only when the script is executed directly.
    # It will not run if the script is imported as a module.
    calculator()  # Call the main calculator function to start the REPL.

# General Programming Good Practices Demonstrated:
# - **Modular Design**: The code is organized into classes and functions, making it easier to understand and maintain.
# - **Encapsulation**: Data and methods are encapsulated within classes, promoting data hiding and abstraction.
# - **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Base classes define common interfaces, and derived classes implement specific behaviors.
# - **Exception Handling**: The code anticipates and handles potential errors gracefully, providing informative feedback.
# - **Logging**: Comprehensive logging is implemented to track the application's behavior and assist in debugging.
# - **Type Hinting**: Type hints improve code readability and help with static analysis tools.
# - **Documentation and Comments**: Detailed comments and docstrings explain the purpose and functionality of code components.
# - **Adherence to PEP 8**: The code follows Python's style guidelines for improved readability.

# Conclusion:
# This code serves as a comprehensive example of how to implement several key object-oriented design patterns in Python.
# By understanding the who, what, why, where, when, and how of each component, students can gain a deeper appreciation
# for the art and science of OOP. The combination of design patterns, logging, debugging, and good programming practices
# results in code that is robust, maintainable, and scalable.
